# DataCamp Notes 

Welcome to my `datacamp-notes` repository! This repository serves as my personal codebook, tracking my journey of leveling up my Python, R, SQL and PowerBI on DataCamp\*. It is a compilation of markdown files summarizing various functions, concepts, and lessons I have encountered across different courses.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders for each track. Within these track folders, each course has its own `.md` file.

Here is a basic view of the repository's structure:

```
datacamp-notes
│   README.md
│
└───Track_1
│   │   Course_1.md
│   │   Course_2.md
│   │   ...
│
└───Track_2
│   │   Course_1.md
│   │   Course_2.md
│   │   ...
```

## File Structure

Each `.md` file corresponds to a single course and includes the following sections for each function learned in that course:

- **Function Name:** The name of the function along with the library it belongs to. Example: `sns.histplot()`

- **Description:** A brief explanation of what the function does, its context, and its advantages over similar functions in other libraries. 

- **Function Signature:** A representation of the function signature, showing the function's parameters and their default values, if any. This section includes both mandatory and optional parameters.

- **Parameters:** An itemized list detailing each parameter in the function signature. Each item includes the parameter's name, its expected data type, its default value (if any), and a brief description of its role in the function.

- **Example of Use:** One or more practical examples demonstrating how the function can be used. Each example includes the necessary import statements, data preparation (if any), function usage, and results visualization, along with a brief explanation of the example.

- **Additional Information:** This section contains any other useful information about the function. It may include insights, tips, common use cases, potential issues, or any other information that may enhance understanding or usage of the function.

This structure is used consistently throughout the `.md` files, making it easy to follow along and understand the functions and their applications.
