# Code Exercises from Preprocessing for Machine Learning in Python #

## Chapter 1

### --- Exercise 1 --- ###

# Drop the Latitude and Longitude columns from volunteer
volunteer_cols = volunteer.drop(
                        labels = ['Latitude', 'Longitude'],
                        axis = 1
)

# Drop rows with missing category_desc values from volunteer_cols
volunteer_subset = volunteer_cols.dropna(subset=['category_desc'])

# Print out the shape of the subset
print(volunteer_subset.shape)


### --- Exercise 2 --- ###

# Print the head of the hits column
print(volunteer["hits"].head())

# Convert the hits column to type int
volunteer["hits"] = volunteer['hits'].astype(int)

# Look at the dtypes of the dataset
print(volunteer.dtypes)


### --- Exercise 3 --- ###

# Create a DataFrame with all columns except category_desc
X = volunteer.drop('category_desc', axis=1)

# Create a category_desc labels dataset
y = volunteer[['category_desc']]

# Use stratified sampling to split up the dataset according to the y dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, random_state=42)

# Print the category_desc counts from y_train
print(y_train['category_desc'].value_counts())
